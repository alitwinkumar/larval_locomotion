SUMMARY:
This repository contains scripts and data used in:
A. A. Zarin, B. Mark, A. Cardona, A. Litwin-Kumar & C. Q. Doe (2019). A multilayer circuit architecture for the generation of distinct motor behaviors in Drosophila. eLife 8, e51781.

There are four parts: 
(1) Image_Processing:  This contains the scripts necessary for dealing with the raw imaging data.  To run, use Muscle_GCamp and follow the prompts.  The outputs are .mat files which can be used for analysis.

(2) GCamp_Analysis: These scrips do the bulk of the analysis for figures 2 and 3.  To run these, use muscle_gcamp_compiler once for each direction (fwd and bwd).  

(3) EM_analysis: This uses EM data to look at the distributions of motor neuron synapses for figure 5.  The input is a data structure containing anatomical and connectivity information for the motor neurons.  The MN and PMN EM data has been included. 

(4) RNN: Implementation of a connectome-constrained recurrent network model of motor and premotor neurons. Uses Python (python.org) and TensorFlow (tensorflow.org). Tested on Python 3.7.3, TensorFlow 1.14.
